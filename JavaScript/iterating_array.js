/*
Can you describe the main difference between the Array.forEach() loop and Array.map() methods and why you would pick one versus the other?
Ð¡an you describe other popular methods for iterating over arrays?

Array.forEach() loop and Array.map() methods are both used to iterate over arrays, but they have some key differences.
Array.forEach() loop is used to execute a function on each element of an array, but it does not return a new array. It simply executes the function for each element in the array.
